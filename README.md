# API-Webapp

This project is about an exhibition app used to display, comment on and reserve art. The page was built using JavaScript and bundled with Webpack and uses API calls. The webapp has 3 user interfaces:
  - A home page showing a list of items that you can "like".
    * Made by: [Molnar Emese](https://github.com/Mesi21)
  - A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to leave a comment.
    * Made by: [Jeff Kayombo](https://github.com/JEFFKAY16)
  - A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to make a reservation.
    * Made by: [Hamza Tarar](https://github.com/Lockless404)
